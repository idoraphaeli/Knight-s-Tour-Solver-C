# Knight-s-Tour-Solver-C
Developed a console-based knight’s tour solver on a 5x5 chessboard. Designed and implemented a pathfinding algorithm using recursion, backtracking, and custom data structures (linked lists, trees, matrices). Managed dynamic memory manually and validated user input. The solution prints the knight’s path and visualizes it in a board format.
